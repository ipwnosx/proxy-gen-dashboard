Algorithm for proxy location optimization:


Optimization MUST be done on the client since by the time we get to the server,
  the server has already been selected...

----------

Example package combo:
[Luminati static, Luminati Residential, Smartproxy Datacenter]

Example server list:
{
  s1: optimized for Luminati,
  s2: optimized for Luminati,
  s3: optimized for smartproxy,
  s4: optimized for smartproxy
}


Example number of proxies to generate: 30

Algorithm:

1.) Spread proxies evenly across providers. In this example case, 10 proxies would be generated for each provider.
So we have something like this:
{
  Luminati Static: 10,
  Luminati Residential: 10,
  Smartproxy Datacenter: 10
}

2.) Loop through the proxy list, the one that we made in step 1. 
      Generate proxies for each provider, spreading them out evenly among servers that are optimized for that provider.
      If there are no servers optimized for that provider, spread them out evenly among all servers.
